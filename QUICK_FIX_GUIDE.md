## 🔍 Console Logs (For Debugging)

Open your browser's Developer Tools (F12) and watch the Console tab. You'll see helpful messages:

```
✅ Product changed: {...}           ← Database update detected
✅ Variation changed: {...}         ← Variation update detected
📡 Real-time subscription status: SUBSCRIBED
👁️ Window focused - refreshing products...
👁️ Tab became visible - refreshing products...
```

If you see these messages, the real-time system is working!

## ⚡ How It Works

### Automatic Updates Triggered By:

1. **Database Changes** - Supabase real-time events
2. **Tab Focus** - When you click back into the tab
3. **Visibility Change** - When tab becomes visible
4. **Manual Refresh** - When you click the Refresh button (🔄)

### Data Flow:
```
Admin Dashboard
      ↓
   Edit Price
      ↓
Supabase Database
      ↓
Real-time Event
      ↓
All Browser Tabs Update
      ↓
   Website Shows New Price!
```

## 🎨 New UI Elements

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Changes aren't appearing"

Try these steps in order:

1. **Wait 2-3 seconds** - Give real-time a chance to sync
2. **Click the Refresh button** (🔄) in the admin
3. **Switch to another tab and back** - Triggers visibility refresh
4. **Hard refresh the page** - Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
5. **Check the console** - Look for error messages
6. **Verify the database** - Check Supabase dashboard to confirm data was saved

### "Real-time not working"

Check your Supabase project:
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to **Database → Replication**
3. Ensure these tables have real-time enabled:
   - ✅ `products`
   - ✅ `product_variations`

### "Edit button not showing"

Make sure you're clicking the **Layers icon** (📦) first to open the Variation Manager, then look for the **Edit button** (✏️) next to each variation.
